## SuperTokens backend configuration

Open up the file <RenderBackendConfigPath /> from the downloaded folder. This is where SuperTokens's backend SDK is configured. There are different parts to the configuration:

- Connection to the core..
- `appInfo`:
    - The value of `apiDomain` is: <RenderAPIDomain />. This is where the auth APIs will be exposed to to the frontend.
    - The value of `websiteDomain` is: <RenderWebsiteDomain />. <IsMobileFrontend>Since your frontend is a mobile app, this value does not matter much. It's used when generating links like email verification or password reset (if you have chosen email password), however, we override these links in the backend config to be deep links to the mobile app before sending them to the user's email.</IsMobileFrontend><IsWebFrontend>This link is where your frontend UI will show.</IsWebFrontend>

<ul>
<li><code>recipeList</code>: We initialise all the necessary recipes based on your selection of login methods:</li>
<ul>
<li>Session recipe: Responsible for issuing and verifying session tokens</li>
<li>Dashboard recipe: Enables the dashboard, accessible on the <RenderDashboardRoute /> route </li>
<li>User roles: Enables setting roles and permissions for users</li>
<li>User metadata: Enables setting JSON metadata for users</li>
<li>Multi tenancy recipe: This will enable multi tenancy in supertokens, and expose APIs to the frontend which can be used to get information about which login method is configured for a tenant.</li>
<IsRecipeInit recipe="emailpassword"><li> Email password recipe: This recipe exposes the email password related APIs like email password sign up or sign in, along with the reset password APIs.</li></IsRecipeInit>
<IsRecipeInit recipe="passwordless"><li> Passwordless recipe: This recipe exposes the passwordless login based APIs (for magic link or otp based login).</li></IsRecipeInit>
<IsRecipeInit recipe="thirdparty"><li> Third Party recipe: Exposes APIs for social or enterprise SSO login. This list of third party providers will be configured via API calls for each tenant in your application.</li></IsRecipeInit>
<IsRecipeInit recipe="mfa"><li> Multi factor recipe: Allows you to configure secondary factors required for each tenant. We will provide a list of first and second factors for each tenant during the tenant configuration step.</li></IsRecipeInit>
</ul>
</ul>

### Configuring tenants

There are two steps in configuring tenants:
- Creating tenants and setting login methods for them.
- If third party is enabled for the tenant, then we want to configure the third party providers for the tenant.

<IsRecipeInit recipe="passwordless"><li> Passwordless recipe: This recipe exposes the passwordless login based APIs (for magic link or otp based login). In the geenrated app, we enable OTP and magic link based login, with phone number or email. You can restrict this choice by changing the supplied configuration.</li></IsRecipeInit>
<IsRecipeInit recipe="thirdparty"><li> Third Party recipe: Exposes APIs for social or enterprise SSO login. We also configure a list of third party providers in the app, which you can change based on your needs.</li></IsRecipeInit>
<IsRecipeInit recipe="mfa"><li> Multi factor recipe: Allows you to configure secondary factors required for logging in. The factors configured in this is based on your selection, and by default, it requires all users to setup MFA during sign up. This behaviour can of course be changed.</li></IsRecipeInit>

---------------------

## How will the CLI work?
- We will have the same options method that we have for this guide
- The supertokens config code will have to be generated dynamically from the CLI. So we will have to sort of create a file with the appropriate config.
- As for the frontend, we will have to make individual files for each type of login method, and then fuse them together in the frontend code to create a login UI that has all the different types of login methods. We can have like a 

```
Login with email password

or

login with passwordless

or

login with third party
```

buttons in the login UI
