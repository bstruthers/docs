# AWS Setup with Stacksnap

Stacksnap is a community supported AWS installer with unofficial SuperTokens support. You can use it to quickly deploy a solid starter deployment of SuperTokens on AWS.

## Deploying SuperTokens on AWS using Stacksnap âœ¨

- Visit the [SuperTokens Stacksnap page](https://klo.dev/stacksnap/apps/supertokens/)
- Click on the "Deploy to AWS" button

The 1-click installer automatically sets up an ECS task running SuperTokens, a Postgres DB on RDS for data storage, and an HTTPS url load balanced with a CloudFront distribution.
